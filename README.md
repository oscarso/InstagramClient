Completed user stories:
 * [x] Required: User can view a list of Instagram photos 


Note: 
I submitted this app into Google Play and got rejected due to:
"Your app submission has been rejected for a violation of the Google Play Developer Program Policy regarding Impersonation or Deceptive Behavior."
I believe Google Play does not want another Instagram Client in the store.
